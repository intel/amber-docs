# Block Chain
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved. - IBM: https://www.ibm.com/topics/what-is-blockchain.
Block chain relies on many node's participation to form a cluster and a voting system for leger generation. How to allow a trust node to join the cluster is fundamental. Many blockchain solutions start to require cluster node to run inside TEE. Amber provides the attestation service and policy match to enforce each node running in TEE.
