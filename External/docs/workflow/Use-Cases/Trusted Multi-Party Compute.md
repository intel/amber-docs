# vTrusted multi-party compute

Industrial data flow generates huge business values for all data holders, but how to guarantee secure data sharing is a big challenge that hinders companies to maximize the potentials from their data, as well as utilizing the data from others. The industryâ€™s answers to these challenges are relying on complicated algorithms that follow strict security proofs, such as secure multiparty computations that break the secrets into many shares to distribute/exchange among multiple parties, or Homomorphic encryption that enables arithmetical computations working directly on encrypted data. Those software-based solutions require perfect executions to ensure the security, and their complexities have already become its own vulnerabilities, not even to mention the huge performance overhead on computation and networks. It is even more of a challenge when involved parties want to verify that the computation results are trust worthy, as there could be malicious or adversary parties participating the multi-party computation. Techniques such as Zero Knowledge Proof could help, but the additional computation overhead will make the solution almost impossible to use in addressing real industry challenges.

Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a hardware solution developed to meet this challenge. It is led by Intel in the form of Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and Intel Trust Domain Extensions, (TDX). The secure enclave or trusted domain provides secure and verifiable hardware environments that can replace, or assist either MPC, or HE to provide secure multi-party computations utilizing the secure hardware; so that participating parties can share their secure data with the ease of mind their data will be protected by Intel secure hardware. 

 In general terms, the TEE offers an execution space that provides a higher level of security for trusted applications running on the device than a rich operating system (OS) and more functionality than a 'secure element' (SE).
 
In addition to the secure environment that guarantees the computation secrecy and privacies of all involving parties who share their data across domains, Intel also provides Amber trust services that are built based on hardware attestation components and trusty hardware CA endorsed by Intel. Amber will serve as a trusty worthy 3rd party in multi-party computation, allowing all participants to verify the correct workload/data from other participants remotely, and make correct decisions based on Intel Amber service to protect their valuable data assets. Intel SGX/TDX with Intel Amber Service is Intel's answer to real world trusted multi-party computation challenges and is now being evaluated and adopted by many industrial partners.
