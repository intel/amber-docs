# Secret/Key Management
There are many key management service (KMS), either as software implementation (e.g. vault), hardware security module (HSM), or KMS provided by cloud service provider. Most of the KMS release keys based on traditional authN/authZ mechanism. This can protect who can access the key, but whether the key can be protected at client side is unknow. Amber offers a service called key broker service (KBS). KBS can be deployed in front of transitional KMS as proxy to verify if the client where the request comes from runs inside a TEE with Amber attestation service. This protect the secret or key end to end.
