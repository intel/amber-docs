## Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)
A Zero Trust network does not trust devices by default, even if the devices are within a notional "corporate perimeter.” The ZTNA’s model is “never trust, always verify.” Businesses such as banks and large corporations with hybrid or fully remote staff that use ZTNA can benefit from Amber’s trust broker. Trust broker can in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), such as Intel’s Software Guard Extension (SGX) or Trust Domain Extensions (TDX). Having employees work all over the county and/or world requires more robust security and Amber provides that security.
