# Policy Management

## Description

An attestation policy is used to evaluate the evidence and determine whether Amber will issue an attestation token. 

Amber supports the below functions:  

- View all Policies associated with an API Key.
    - User Defined Policies are optional.
    - Policy operations are independent of user roles.
    - A default system generated policy is always processed as part of Amber Attestation. 
- Update Policies
    - New or existing policies can be associated with a API key at the time of creation or by editing an existing API key.
- Create or Delete Policies
    - New or existing policies can be associated with a API key at the time of creation or by editing an existing API key.

**Note: A user created Policies, Tags and API Keys does not get deleted when that user is deleted.**
