# Tags

## Description

Tags are metadata elements, like key-value pairs, that can be applied to the Tenant’s API Keys. These can be used to identify usage based on settings that are relevant to your organization. Amber supports two types of Tags – Pre-Defined tags and User-Defined Tags.  

Amber supports the below functions:  

- View all Tags associated with an API Key
    - Tags are optional
    - Tags operations are independent of user roles
    - A Pre-Defined Tag called Workload is always available for use
- Update Tags
    - Tags can be created at the time of API Key Creation or we can edit tags to an existing API Key
- Create or Delete Tags
    - Tags can be created at the time of API Key Creation or we can edit tags to an existing API Key

_Example: A common usage of Workload tag is to track workloads that are used by a particular API key_

**Note: Tag operations are supported only through the Amber Portal. There are no CLIs to support Tag operations.**
