# Confidential Container Using Gramine
Gramine is a lightweight guest OS, designed to run a single Linux application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can run applications in an isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a complete OS in a virtual machine.
Gramine supports running Linux applications using the Intel SGX (Software Guard Extensions) technology (we sometimes call this version Gramine-SGX). With Intel SGX, applications are secured in hardware-encrypted memory regions (called SGX enclaves). SGX protects code and data in the enclave against privileged software attacks and against physical attacks on the hardware off the CPU package (e.g., cold-boot attacks on RAM). 

Gramine is able to run unmodified applications inside SGX enclaves, without the toll of manually porting the application to the SGX environment. Using Gramine Shielded Containers (GSC) we provide the infrastructure to deploy Docker containers protected by Intel SGX enclaves using the Gramine Library OS.
