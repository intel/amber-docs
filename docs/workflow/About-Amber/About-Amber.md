# About Intel Amber

## Increasing Trust in Confidential Computing
As enterprises increasingly look to multi/hybrid-cloud environments, there’s growing interest in a trusted third-party assurance service and new implementation of a trust authority to help build higher confidence in moving sensitive data to the cloud.

Project Amber introduces an innovative approach to objective third-party attestation.

## Project Amber Decoded
Project Amber is the code name for Intel’s groundbreaking service/SaaS-based implementation of an independent trust authority that provides attestation of workloads in a public/private multi-cloud environment.

Designed to remotely verify and assert trustworthiness of compute assets such as Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), devices, Roots of Trust, and more, the service is operationally independent from the Cloud/Edge infrastructure provider hosting the confidential computing workloads.

### Key Benefits

Enables enterprises to use a single trust authority regardless of where the workload runs.
Integrates with a cloud provider’s assurance services as a value-add or acts as an independent, third-party assessment, increasing confidence in trustworthiness of sensitive workloads.
Designed to be cloud-agnostic, Project Amber will support workloads in the public cloud, within private/hybrid cloud and at the edge.
Intel is working with independent software vendors (ISVs) to enable trust services that include Project Amber.

New tools, such as published APIs that enable ISVs to incorporate Project Amber to augment their own software and services, will complement Intel’s platforms and technologies and increase value to customers and partners.

Project Amber is Intel’s first step in creating a new multi-cloud, multi-TEE service for third-party attestation and will drive forward adoption of confidential computing for the broader industry.

The initial customer pilot, launching by the end of the year, will support confidential compute workloads deployed as bare metal containers, virtual machines (VMs), and containers running in virtual machines using Intel TEEs. The intent is to extend coverage to other TEEs in market in 2023.
